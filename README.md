Jupyter notebooks for analysis of MPAS-A Aquaplanet simulations

This repository contains several notebooks used for comparison of different MPAS-A aquaplanet simulations. At present, the code mostly focuses on the general circulation and extreme precipitation. More code will be added as new analyses and diagnostics are developed.
